Here's the work and code for my fashion chatbot that will one day hopefully be able to recommend fashionable outfits, store and load clothing from the cloud, and make people look snazzy!

**Data structures and algorithms used: **
- do/try control flow
- hash maps
- chrono, flush, time delay
- const auto type inferencing
- random_device, Mersenne Twister Generators
- streams and single streams

**Data structures and algorithms I plan to implement: ** 
- Prefix tree for efficient name-based autocorrect
- graph traversal functions based on user preferences
- hash maps and linked lists for recent history
- outfit optimization algorithm based on dynamic scoring
- dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path between fashion options through styles and colors
- k means cluster algorithms for style recommendations
